JSLint.vs Forked Version by Bruno Caimar 
This is a fork from JSLint.VS addIn (http://jslint.codeplex.com/)

This is NOT an official version!


Original description from JSLint.VS 
-----------------------------------
JSLint.VS is Add-In for Visual Studio that provides errors in JavaScript during compiling enabling you to spend less time in browser catching bugs and typos.

JSLint.VS provides validation on file, code section, or by integrating JavaScript verification with a build.
-----------------------------------


I'll just test something here and updated the version of jslint.js
